**Project FINALBYTE (1.2)**

**Name:** FINALBYTE
**Subtitle:** Unified audio-visual expansion system for 8-bit platforms (Atari 800XL, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum)

---

### 🔧 Project Goal:
FINALBYTE is a cross-platform enhancement system for classic 8-bit computers, providing modern audio and visual capabilities while preserving full compatibility with original hardware and software.

FINALBYTE delivers:
- 🎵 Wavetable and sampled audio with FX (reverb, echo, pitch-shift)
- 🎨 Graphical overlay with alpha channel, color palettes and sprites
- ⚙️ Unified address/control interface across platforms

---

### 🚀 Supported Platforms:
- Atari 800XL / 130XE
- Commodore 64
- ZX Spectrum (128k / AY)

---

### 🌈 Architecture:

#### ▶ FINALBYTE Module
- External hardware (ESP32 / RPi Pico / STM32 / FPGA / RP2040)
- Intercepts bus or I/O instructions from host system
- Includes:
  - 🎵 Sound engine: multisample, WAV, FX, stereo output
  - 🎨 Overlay engine: 320x200px, 16/32 color, 4-bit alpha
  - 📊 Memory bank: SD card / SPI flash for samples and graphics

#### ▶ Communication with Host System
- Passive sniffer (listens to POKEY/SID/Beeper instructions)
- Active control via:
  - `$D700+` (Atari)
  - `$DF00+` (C64)
  - `OUT (n),a` with prefix (ZX)

---

### 🆕 ✨ FINALBYTE Enhancements:

#### 🖥️ 1. Video Overlay (Amiga-style)
- Full overlay system:
  - Captures original video signal (ZX/C64/Atari)
  - Syncs to VSYNC
  - Adds FINALBYTE HUD, cursors, effects
- Chip variant: RP2040 / STM32 / FPGA
- Modes:
  - Overlay HUD – additional layer only
  - Overlay Full – full-screen overlay (cutscenes, maps)
  - Overlay Off – passthrough only

#### 🖱️ 2. USB Keyboard and Mouse
- Direct USB HID connection via USB host (ESP32-S3)
- Mouse moves overlay cursor independently from host CPU
- HID support for mouse movement/clicks + key scanning for GUI/adventure/strategy games

#### 🧱 3. "Lite" Tile System (16×16 tiles, 32×32 maps)
- Lightweight background engine:
  - Tile size: 16×16 px
  - Visible grid: 20×14 tiles
  - 2 layers (parallax + HUD)
- Easy entry point for new devs
- Smooth scrolling without DMA

#### 🎞️ 4. FPS Optimization + Cinematic Modes
- Recommended: 30 fps overlay refresh, 24 fps animation
- Host CPU can run as low as 8 fps without visible drop
- FINALBYTE cinematic loop™ – optional filmic mode

### 🧠 Planned Upgrades for Finalbyte Release:

#### 🎵 Sound Sample Banks
- 4 independent sample banks: 1 built-in + 3 switchable
- `BANK 0`: Core ROM (default FX: shoot, explosion, pickup…)
- `BANK 1–3`: User-defined banks (modpacks, game-specific, scene)
- Switch via: `FINALBYTE_SET_SFX_BANK(n); // 0–3`
- Samples called with: `FINALBYTE_PLAY_SAMPLE(0x12);` – playback depends on active bank

#### 🎨 Sprite/Tile Graphics Banks
- 4 switchable sets, dynamic during gameplay
- `BANK 0`: Retro GUI, HUD, enemies
- `BANK 1–3`: Thematic sets (dungeon, city, sci-fi)
- Switch via: `FINALBYTE_SET_GFX_BANK(n); // 0–3`
- Each bank includes:
  - 16×16 and 32×32 tiles
  - Animations, icons, HUD elements

#### 🌐 Wi-Fi Connectivity (ESP32)
- For modpack download, online play, sync
- Auto-connect via SD `config.ini` or overlay Wi-Fi menu
- Configuration via GUI overlay or retro console UI
- Remote modpack fetch:
  - Loads `gfx.bank`, `sfx.bank`, `manifest.yaml`
  - Saves to SD and auto-activates
- API endpoints prepared for:
  - Version verification
  - Bank updates
  - Multiplayer handshake

---

### 🎧 Sound Engine:
- 8/12/16-bit samples
- Wavetable playback (velocity, pitch, offset, loop)
- Effects: reverb, delay, filter, saturation
- Command set: `NOTE_ON`, `PLAY_SAMPLE`, `SET_VOLUME`, `FX_ON`, etc.

---

### 🖼️ Overlay Engine:
- 320x200px, 4-bit alpha, 16/32 color palettes ("ST" and "Amiga" modes)
- Sprite support:
  - Positioning, Z-order, animation
  - HUD, icons, labels
- Transparency, blinking, fade
- Controlled via mapped registers or ports

---

### 🧠 Collision Detection (in external system):
- Hundreds of sprite collisions handled in real-time
- Host system reads back collision results via buffer:

#### 📥 Collision feedback:
1. **Memory-mapped collision buffer** (recommended):
   - Example: `$D780–$D79F` (Atari), `$DF80–$DFA0` (C64)
   - Entries in pairs: `SPRITE_ID_A`, `SPRITE_ID_B`, ends with zero
   - Host polls buffer and reacts (hit, overlap, pickup)

2. **Optional: Bitmask matrix**
   - 256×256 bit matrix stored in FINALBYTE module
   - Any pair can be queried

---

### 🌐 Compatibility & Philosophy:
- ❌ No modification to original hardware/software
- ✉️ All commands are non-invasive or in unused I/O ranges
- 🏆 Games remain playable on stock machines in "Lite mode"
- 🌿 Full version activates automatically if module is detected (e.g. handshake on `$D7FF`)

---

### 🎮 Use Cases:
- Cross-platform remakes (Bruce Lee, Saboteur, The Last Ninja)
- New ambient/adventure games with music and voice
- Real-time demos (beat sync, layered effects)
- VJ/live setups with retro computers as controllers

---

### 🏅 Status:
- ✏️ Architecture designed
- 📄 Address and protocol documentation in progress
- ⚖️ Planned open-source release (HW + FW + dev libs)

---

**FINALBYTE = One spirit, three legends.**
Together, we bring 8-bit creativity into a new golden age.
